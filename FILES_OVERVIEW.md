# File Overview

This repository contains firmware for an STM32F756ZG board along with a Python host utility. Below is a description of each project file and its role.

## Root

- **host_sanity.py** – Python script that talks to the board over a serial port, sends AES test vectors, and validates the returned ciphertext.

## IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int (project root)

- **.project** – Eclipse/STM32CubeIDE project metadata (name, paths).
- **.mxproject** – STM32CubeMX configuration used to regenerate project code.
- **IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int.txt** – Human‑readable export of the CubeMX pin/peripheral configuration.
- **IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int.ioc** – Machine‑readable CubeMX configuration file.
- **.cproject** – STM32CubeIDE build configuration settings.
- **IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int Debug.cfg** – Debugger launch configuration for STM32CubeIDE.
- **IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int Debug.launch** – Additional launch information for debugging sessions.
- **IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int.pdf** – Project documentation or reference schematic generated by CubeMX.
- **STM32F756ZGTX_FLASH.ld** – Linker script mapping program sections to on‑chip Flash memory.
- **STM32F756ZGTX_RAM.ld** – Linker script for RAM‑only builds.
- **Debug/makefile** – Auto‑generated makefile used to compile the firmware.
- **Debug/objects.mk** – List of object files produced during the build.
- **Debug/sources.mk** – Lists source files and include paths for the build.
- **Debug/objects.list** – Detailed list of object file paths.
- **Debug/IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int.elf** – Compiled firmware image in ELF format.
- **Debug/IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int.list** – Disassembly listing of the built firmware.
- **Debug/IKNP-Handle-F7-before-int.map** – Linker map showing memory layout and symbol addresses.
- **.settings/com.st.stm32cube.ide.mcu.sfrview.prefs** – STM32CubeIDE register view preferences.
- **.settings/language.settings.xml** – Language and toolchain discovery settings for the IDE.
- **.settings/stm32cubeide.project.prefs** – General project preferences for STM32CubeIDE.
- **Drivers/STM32F7xx_HAL_Driver/LICENSE.txt** – License for ST's Hardware Abstraction Layer sources.
- **Drivers/CMSIS/LICENSE.txt** – License for ARM's CMSIS core libraries.

## Core/Inc (header files)

- **main.h** – Central header defining pin mappings, peripheral handles, and common includes.
- **stm32f7xx_hal_conf.h** – Configuration of the HAL library modules to compile.
- **stm32f7xx_it.h** – Declarations for interrupt handler functions.
- **aes.h** – Interface for the AES helper routines used by the firmware.

## Core/Src (source files)

- **main.c** – Application entry point implementing the IKNP protocol stages, UART communication, and AES‑based computation.
- **aes.c** – Implements AES block operations (TinyAES) used by the protocol.
- **stm32f7xx_it.c** – Definitions of interrupt service routines, e.g., UART handler feeding protocol state machine.
- **stm32f7xx_hal_msp.c** – HAL MSP (MCU Support Package) initialization for peripherals.
- **system_stm32f7xx.c** – Sets up system clocks, cache, and low‑level CPU configuration.
- **syscalls.c** – Stubs for system calls required by the C library (e.g., `_write`, `_sbrk`).
- **sysmem.c** – Minimal heap management routines for the C runtime.

## Drivers/STM32F7xx_HAL_Driver/Src

Auto‑generated ST HAL drivers providing hardware abstractions:

- **stm32f7xx_hal_*.c** – Modules for AES/CRYP, RNG, HASH, GPIO, UART, TIM, DMA, RCC, PWR, EXTI, and more. Each file wraps low‑level peripheral registers with C functions. These are standard library files and normally not modified.

## Drivers/STM32F7xx_HAL_Driver/Inc

Corresponding headers declaring the HAL functions for each peripheral (GPIO, UART, RNG, etc.).

## Drivers/CMSIS

ARM CMSIS headers defining core register structures, interrupt vectors, and startup data for the Cortex‑M7 processor.
